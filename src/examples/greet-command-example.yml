description: >
  This example demonstrates how to use the "`greet`" `Orb` command, and especially how to
  pass a value at runtime, to the `greet` `Orb` command, using `Orb` parameters :
  * The first `greet` command call, will welcome "Paul", "Marc", and "Jean" in the "devops" Team
  * The second `greet` command call, will welcome "Alexandre", "Yann", and "Laurie" in the "development" Team

# Provide a use-case based example for using this orb.
# Everything in the `usage` section will be displayed in the orb registry.
# Comments are not retained.
usage:
  version: 2.1
