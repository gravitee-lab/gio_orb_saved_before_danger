    This bot routes pull request to a different Circle CI workflow, based on git branch names, e.g. :
      * if prefix is `issues-`, or `feature-` then one workflow, designed for dev team work flow
      * if prefix is `support-`, then another workflow, designed for support team work flow
      * etc ...

steps:
  - run:
      name: "Running the Pull Request Bot"
      command: <<include(scripts/pr_bot.sh)>>
